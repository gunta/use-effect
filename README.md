# 🚫 Don't useEffect, use Effect

> **One space. Infinite clarity. Zero outages.**

A viral landing page campaign educating developers about the dangers of `useEffect` misuse and introducing Effect-TS as the elegant solution.

## 🎯 The Mission

Inspired by the September 2025 incident where a misused `useEffect` hook caused a major outage, it's time to save the world from React's most dangerous API. This landing page is a humorous yet educational campaign to:

- Warn developers about `useEffect` pitfalls
- Introduce Effect-TS as a better alternative
- Provide AGENTS.md to teach AI coding assistants better practices
- Save production environments worldwide

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev

# Open http://localhost:4321
```
