# Product Requirements Document: "Don't useEffect, use Effect" Campaign

## 🎯 Vision Statement
Create a viral, memorable landing page that humorously educates developers about the dangers of useEffect misuse while introducing Effect-TS as the elegant solution to managing side effects in modern applications.

## 🔥 Campaign Tagline
**"Don't useEffect, use Effect"**
*One space. Infinite clarity. Zero outages.*

## 📋 Background
- A major tech company experienced a significant outage in September 2025 due to misused useEffect hooks
- The incident involved a React useEffect hook with a problematic object in its dependency array
- useEffect is one of the most misunderstood React hooks, leading to:
  - Memory leaks
  - Infinite loops
  - Race conditions
  - Performance degradation
  - Production outages

## 🎨 Core Concept
A minimalist, bold landing page that plays on the space between "use" and "Effect" as a metaphor for the clarity and separation of concerns that Effect-TS brings to side effect management.

## 📝 Key Messages

### Primary Headlines
1. **"Don't useEffect, use Effect"**
2. **"A single space could have prevented the outage"**
3. **"Remove side effects from your life (and your code)"**

### Supporting Copy Lines
- "That tiny space? It's worth millions in prevented outages"
- "useEffect: The hook that launched a thousand bugs"
- "Effect-TS: Because production deserves better"
- "Stop effects from using you"
- "The space between chaos and control"
- "Break the cycle. Literally."
- "Your dependencies called. They want a divorce."

## 🎯 Target Audience

### Primary
- React developers who've been burned by useEffect
- Senior engineers tired of reviewing useEffect disasters
- Teams who've experienced production incidents

### Secondary
- AI coding assistants (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, etc.)
